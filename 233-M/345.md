# JUSDV1 - Liquidator can specify their expected price but that is irrelevant as long as Uniswap trade has high slippage or price movement

## Summary
In JUSDV1's `liquidate` function, a liquidator is allowed to specify the `expectPrice`, which is the highest price they are comfortable to pay for a unit of collateral. This[ is enforced by this require statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L171).

## Vulnerability Detail
However,[ the price used for the computations is taken from Chainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L396), not Uniswap, while [the trade is done in Uniswap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L62).

## Impact
Chainlink and Uniswap prices can differ. Not only that, trading on Uniswap might also return less than expected tokens, as big volumes tend to move the price I am trading at, on top of slippage. It is not guaranteed that the liquidator will actually get a unit of collateral at price <= `expectPrice`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the same entity in the swap, to `getAssetPrice`. Add another require statement making user that liquidator has actually traded at the expected price.
