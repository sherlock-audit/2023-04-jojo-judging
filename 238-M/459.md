# GeneralRepay#repayJUSD returns excess USDC to `to` address rather than msg.sender

## Summary

When using GeneralRepay#repayJUSD to repay a position on JUSDBank, any excess tokens are sent to the `to` address. While this is fine for users that are repaying their own debt this is not good when repaying for another user. Additionally, specifying an excess to repay is basically a requirement when attempting to pay off the entire balance of an account. This combination of factors will make it very likely that funds will be refunded incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/GeneralRepay.sol#L65-L69

            IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, borrowBalance);
            IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(borrowBalance, address(this));
            IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(to, USDCAmount - borrowBalance);
            JUSDAmount = borrowBalance;
        }

As seen above, when there is an excess amount of USDC, it is transferred to the `to` address which is the recipient of the repay. When to != msg.sender all excess will be sent to the recipient of the repay rather than being refunded to the caller.

## Impact

Refund is sent to the wrong address if to != msg.sender
